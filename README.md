# hello-world
My first github repository since CS2.

My name is Susanne and I'm currently a senior undergrad student. I made a github (this github?) three years ago for my CS2 class, but haven't touched github since. I remember hating both github and Java, the coding language we used in that class, mostly because I honestly kind of just hated CS2. I remember setting up github and installing Java, as well as learning how to write my first Java program and how to push that program onto github, because the experience was so painful. I agonized over it for days on my own, at my TA's office hours, and at my professor's office hours. The class experience didn't improve from there. I had gone from learning how to code user input in Python to coding data structures in Java in the span of one winter break. What a yikes. 
But now, looking back on it, both github and Java aren't so horrible. I took my second Java class last semester (was too afraid to take a Java class before then) and coding in it wasn't stressful at all. (My assignments were stressful though.) So far, github seems OK too. We'll see. (I'll see? Unsure about this grammar. Who's the other person besides me that will "see"? Er...my future self and me?)
